            A one week project to build something from scratch and release it somewhere. Fairly basic blockbreak clone
            with a bit of a twist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Main features:
            <ul>
              <li>Shoot cannonballs to break blocks, but don't let them hit you.</li>
              <li>Stores high score locally.</li>
              <li>Optional Slack support for posting scores.</li>
              <li>Cross platform for Linux, OSX and Windows.</li>

            A project to create an operating system that's built around using Lua with the intention of being light
            weight.
            The main use case was for a game where you may want many simple in-game operating systems that look like a
            *NIX shell but without actually running a VM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Main features:
            <ul>
              <li>A modified version of the Lua VM that supports running multiple Lua States in the same thread using
                Boost Coroutines</li>
              <li>A virtual file system the supports mounting different types of file systems.</li>
              <li>A RAMFS for virtual files (such as /dev and /proc)</li>
              <li>A persistent file system for long term storage.</li>
              <li>A Fuse implementation that allows for mounting the persistent hard drives and modifying them outside of
                the VM.</li>
            </ul>

            An earlier attempt at creating an OS for use in a game, specifically for a space game.
            This was a relatively naive approach that used NLua which is a C# implementation of Lua for use in Unity.
          </p>

            Main features:
            <ul>
              <li>Basic shell for running Lua.</li>
              <li>A simple VT100 terminal emulator that used built in Unity components for text rendering.</li>
              <li>A very simple file system, however it did not support mounting.</li>

            A small voxel engine aim at being able to create and edit levels entirely within Unity.
            It performed well enough for the scale of the levels I wanted to created, however getting the editor tools to
            behave the way I wanted proved to be the most tricky aspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Main features:
            <ul>
              <li>Chunked editing and loading. Maps are stored as individual binary files which is optimised for updating
                chunks during editing.</li>
              <li>Multiple different shapes beyond a cube such as ramps and different corners to allow for smoother
                terrain.</li>
              <li>Unity editing support for creating levels without needing additional tools.</li>

            A topdown 2D RPG game engine written in C++ built using minimal dependencies for the purpose of learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a fairly old project now, but it does represent a lot of learning in terms of C++, integrating a
            scripting language, handling modding, dealing with complex UI and handling an audio system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Main features:
            <ul>
              <li>Tile based 2D graphics with a tile overlapping system for blending between tiles.</li>
              <li>Sound system that supports streaming OGG and WAV files.</li>
              <li>Lua Bindings for controlling just about every aspect of the game. From how a new game is created and
                loaded to how a door should behave when interacted with.</li>
              <li>Maps are created through Lua and has a mechanism for determining if the map is being played new or
                loaded from disk, allowing for map scripts to upgrade old save files.</li>
              <li>A dialogue system based on The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind with topics, keywords and actions bound to those
                keywords.</li>
              <li>HTML documentation taken from the C++ comments using a Python script.</li>
              <li>In game text uses a simplistic CSS and HTML system for rich text.</li>
              <li>An in game map editor for creating new levels.</li>
            </ul>
