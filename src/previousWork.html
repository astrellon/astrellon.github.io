            Metro Trains Melbourne needed a tool for monitoring real time voltages and currents for testing their new
            trains.
          </p>
          <p>
            This work combined hardware installed in the field (created by my co-worker) and a server with a front end
            (created by me).
          </p>
          <p>
            The hardware was made up of an industrial PC with a USB oscilloscope and 4G modem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating a backend in .Net Core that received the data.</li>
              <li>Creating the frontend for use on a PC or mobile, built using Typescript and React.</li>
              <li>Handling displaying live data of up to 120k samples on a mobile device.</li>
              <li>Storing, retrieving and processes all the data, which ranged between 40k samples per second to 120k
                samples per second.</li>
              <li>Utilising various Amazon Web Services such as EC2 to host the server, RDS to host the database for users
                and config, S3 for long term storage of raw data and SQS as a backup connection should the server go down.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Rome2rio is a travel search website used for finding and comparing different routes from anywhere in the
            world. It specialised
            in ground transport.

            I worked on:

              <li>Internal tools for modifying their data through a web UI (not pictured).</li>
              <li>Expanding upon and improved the infrastructure of their tooling.</li>
              <li>For two years I mentored someone which resulted in them being able to shift from a non-dev role into a

            mental images are a company that specialises in photographic rendering using ray and path tracing software.
            After 3 years the Melbourne office split off to form the company migenius which continued to do the same work
            and allowed for working on stand alone products.
            Bloom Unit was their first product and combined the ease of using SketchUp's 3d editing with real time
            photographic images. <br />
            I worked on:
            <ul>
              <li>The interface between SketchUp (ruby) and Bloom Unit (C++) for keeping the 3d scene in sync.</li>
              <li>The UI (Internet Explorer 6) for adjusting the render settings and configuring the materials.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We also worked on other projects for various clients:
            <ul>
              <li>Integrating Bloom Unit into Autodesk Revit for Oldcastle.</li>
              <li>Web visualisation projects for Obayashi Corporation and Shimizu Corporation.</li>
              <li>A product visualiser for Takemoto products. <a
                  href="http://www3d1.takemotokk.co.jp/takemoto/?lang=en">Bottle 3d Visualiser</a></li>
              <li>A product visualiser for Christ Jewellery. <a href="https://www.christ.de/">Ring Configurator</a></li>
